# Dynamic-energy-simulations-based-on-the-3D-BAG-2.0

This project started as the master thesis work from Yuzhen Jin at the TUDelft.

• The scripts are developed with Python 3 and adapted to the CitySim (v. 22.05.2022) 3DCityDB (v. 5.0.0), Energy ADE (v. 2.0) and PostgreSQL (V. 13).

• The physics library and weather library storage schemas along with the data can be directly installed by importing the SQL files into the database.

• The geometry GML file can be imported into the database via software 3DCityDB importer/exporter.
